The core objective was to design an effective model capable of distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments expressed in movie reviews. Approached this challenge by using an NLP techniques, along with rigorous data pre-processing steps.

Our primary dataset comprised of numerous user-written movie reviews, labeled as either 'positive' or 'negative'. Implemented text preprocessing steps such as tokenisation, stop words removal, and stemming to reduce noise and enhance the efficiency of our models.
